# Open Weather APT

----------

A browser-based APT decoder for NOAA satellites forked from [ThatcherC's github repo](https://github.com/ThatcherC/APT3000), modified to meet the needs of Open Weather.

Open-weather is a project by Sophie Dyer and Sasha Engelmann probing the noisy relationships between bodies, atmospheres and weather systems through experiments in amateur radio, open data and feminist tactics of sensing and s√©ance.

Open Weather APT further includes the work of Grayson Earle and Bill Liles.
